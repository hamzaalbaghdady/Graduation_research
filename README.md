# Graduation Research Proposal

### Introduction

Due to the ongoing war in Gaza, our team faces restrictions on physical meetings. To ensure project continuity, we have adopted an asynchronous workflow using GitHub. Tasks are assigned through GitHub Issues and tracked via the Project board. Team members submit their work through pull requests, enabling peer review, feedback, and discussion. This ensures coordination, accountability, and seamless integration of work despite our physical separation.
